Hospitality and friendly people:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/travel-to-vietnam-friendly-vietnam.jpg\" /><br />\r\n<em>Vietnam friendly</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vast majority of foreigners agree that&nbsp; Vietnamese people are particularly hospitality and friendly.&nbsp; In fact, anywhere in the street, people are ready to help you whether to show you the best way to access the place you would like to arrive or to find a bus if you need it.

Chaotic traffic:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/Vietnam-crazy-traffic.jpg\" style=\"height:340px; width:760px\" /><br />\r\n<em>Traffic in Vietnam</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you arrive in Vietnam at first time, the traffic seems completely scary.<br />\r\nThe streets are filled with all types of vehicles including scooters, motorcycles zigzagging at a frantic pace among cars and trucks. We note that Vietnamese motorcycle drivers do not respect the red lights, even less, the priorities on the right and overtaking on the left. All this is particularly distressing for new arrivals especially if they are pedestrians. However, all visitors agree that this distress could be easily done with some practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.

However, they may adopt some behaviors that can be judged as unpleasant or confusing for westerners.<br />\r\nWe list some examples: No queue up in the public places (supermarket, banks, ect.) or in the crowd, some people do not hesitate to jostle for their way. Some travelers complain the harshness and insistence from the street vendors. Fortunately, these cases are particularly rare and do not affect the overall quality of your experience in Vietnam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>3.

One price is for local and another price for foreigners. In some extreme cases, prices are multiplied by 3 because they are afraid of negotiation or change the traders. Be aware of this. You should check the price or compare the price before purchasing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>4.

In addition, the countryside and the less populated areas of the country are particularly safe for travelers whether travelling alone, group, male or female.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5.

With the higher trunk and larger of leaves in comparison with other tea plants, green tea can be served fresh. There is no need to wilt or oxidize; people can enjoy it right after picking the leaves from the tree. Just&nbsp;fifteen minutes steeping and boiling the tealeaves in hot water, your green tea is ready to be served.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With a tropical climate, Vietnam has been developed as an agricultural country, where people in rural area earn a living mainly from farming.

People have to climb up the tea tree to pick the buds, and it is said that in earlier times, trained monkeys were used to collect tea leave from inaccessible places. Shan tea&rsquo;s buds and young leaves are covered in a thin layer of snowy hair, which creates the name &ldquo;Tr&agrave; Shan Tuyet&rdquo;- or Snowy Shan Tea.

Perhaps, a publicity stunt, Vietnam being a little in the limelight these days. Most tourists staying at Hanoi, if asked to point out the Silk Street, would undoubtedly point to the present Hang Gai and Hang Bong where silk goods and embroidery are now sold, along with custom-tailored clothing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"hanoi-silk-street-silk-product\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/hanoi-silk-street-silk-product.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The red silk Street (Hang Dao) is also a fashionable in the Old Quarter of the capital city, but nowadays it is aligned with jewelry and wristwatch shops, with some clothing stores mixed in. Literally, Hang Dao Street&rsquo;s name reflected the commercial activity that took place there. As early as the 14th and 15th centuries, villagers-mostly from Dan Loan village in Hai Duong province-settled there, forming the guild of Dai Loi. At number 90 a stone stele can still be found, noting that in 1706, the edifice was built as a communal house in hour of the tutelary god of the village and patron saint of dyers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Travel back in time&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nSilk Street, as indicated in the 15th century Treatise on Geography (Dư địa ch&iacute;) by Nguyen Trai, was part of a dyke separating Ho Thai Cuc (Lake of the great primary principle), which is now completely dry, from Hoan Kiem &ndash; The restored sword lake. The two lakes used to communicate with each other through a canal, which lay on site of the present Cau Go Street, thus called in memory of the bridge that once spanned it.&nbsp;<br />\r\nIn his book of poem &ldquo;Vu Trung Tuy But&rdquo; (Collection written on Rainy Days), the author leaves us a vivid descriptions of senses silk street and silver street where the wealth, corruption and fraud of troubled period could be seen. French attacks in 2873 and 1882 reduced the property of Silk Street, which was eventually revived toward the end of the century.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Silk Revolution</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"hanoi-silk-street-silk-manufacture\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/hanoi-silk-street-silk-manufacture.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The face of Silk Street has changes more than once in recent times. At the beginning of the century, its traditional features were still intact: families practiced trading silk and silk fabrics from generation to generation (the craft of dyeing having moved elsewhere, e.g., to the street of the Wooden Bridge). During this period, the street also had a high reputation for the quality of its scholars and mandarins as well as the beauty of its young women, elegant and skillful in commerce, whose plentiful dowries attracted graduates of the newly opened French University.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">On both sides of a badly gravely road, about a hundred shops housed in narrow, low-roofed houses jostled each other in picturesque disorder. There was no pavement. Each shop was made up of two compartments: The outer one was fitted with a small glass-window displaying rows of young or middle-aged, had the job of touting passing customers, many of whom were from the countryside: the inner compartment featured a plank-bed, on which sat the owner of the shop or her daughter, surrounded by glass cases filled with rolls of brocade, flowered satin and silk gauze. Trading in raw silk was also a local specialty. Much haggling usually accompanied the business being done, for as a rule exorbitant prices were asked to begin with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">On every 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, 21st and 26th days of each Lunar month, great animation came to Silk Street. People from weavers&rsquo; villages brought their products: Gauze from La Ca and La Khe and silk-floss from Dai Mo and satin from Buoi market. They also came to buy raw silk. They gave orders to dyers from Cho Dau (Dinh Bang) from areas bordering West Lake, from Buoi, from Dyers&rsquo; street (Tho Nhuom) and from Wooden Bridge Street. After the end of the First World War, Silk Street experienced a measure of modernization. Indians coming from the five French trading posts in India opened shops selling cotton fabrics distributed by French companies (Demarest, Denis Frere, etc.); others called chettys, practiced usury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Shops selling Vietnamese silks decreased in number. Their fronts were arranged like those kept by Indians: a wide glass-window, a counter and a signboard lettered in the romanized vernacular or French instead of a curtain, on which the name of the shop was traced in Chinese characters. The first haberdashery appeared in 1917. By the 1930s Silk Street was dominated by linen-drapers&rsquo; shop also selling fancy goods from Paris: perfumes, cosmetics, hats, neckerchiefs, handkerchiefs, ties and other paraphernalia of modern times. For several decades following the liberation of Ha Noi, which was occupied by French troops from 1946 to 1954, Silk Street&rsquo;s activities were muted, private trade not being encouraged.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Starting from the mid-1980s, however, with the adoption of a market economy, there has been a specular revival, with a mushrooming of watch-makers&rsquo; shops, haberdasheries, shops selling ready to &ndash;wear garments, along with ugly concrete buildings which threaten to disfigure not only Silk Street, but the entire quarter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'hanoi-silk-street- Hang-Gai-Street.jpg', '1', null, 'hanoi silk, silk street ', 'The phrase “Silk Street” evokes the Silk Road has recently become an inspiration for a French in which he titled his book Rue de la Rosie (Silk Street) ', '4', '4', 'hanoi silk, silk street ', '173', '0', '0', '0', '2018-01-10 05:03:12', '2018-01-10 05:03:12', '11');

Long time ago, nearby the Chu river in Thanh Hoa province lived a fisherman named Le Than. On one fine night, Le Than was filled with joy thinking he was going to have a big catch. Pulling the net to the boat side, though, he saw the &ldquo;catch&rdquo; to be nothing but an iron bar resembling a blunt knife without handle. &ldquo;Ah&rdquo; Than sighed, &ldquo;The only catch for the whole night and it turns out to be this worthless piece of iron&rdquo;. Right after that Than threw the rusty iron bar away.&nbsp; Another night, Than cast his another section of the Chu river. After a while, seeing the water bubbling, he hurriedly pulled up his net and saw the same iron bar stuck in the net. Angry more than ever, he threw it away again. Then came another night and Than went fishing in late. At cockcrow, the man pulled up his net and feeling the bottom of the net with his hands, he found the same iron bar. But this time he decided not to throw it away. Bringing the iron bar onto the deck of the boat, he lit a fire in order to take closer look at his mysterious and persistent object. When Than had a chance to see it more clearly, he found out that it was not an iron bar at all: &ldquo;Ah, a sword blade,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">At this time, all over the country floods of people were joining Le Loi&rsquo;s insurgent army. On the two banks of the Chu river, the sounds of horns blaring and the voice of commanders could be heard night after night. Le Than looked at his sword, thinking, &ldquo;God has urged me to go to save my country&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Than abandoned his boat and went to join Le Loi&rsquo;s army. One night when the army had to spend a night in the forest, Than was put on guard over his camps. Le Loi, being a patrol, saw on one side of Le Than&rsquo;s camp something shinning. He walked into the camp out of curiosity. It was the fisherman&rsquo;s sword blade he had seen. Le Than took down the sword blade. Only it lacks a magic hilt to match&rdquo;.&nbsp;Soon after that night, Le Loi and his followers lost a battle and had to retreat into the forest, each man had to find a place to hide, Le Loi took a shelter on the branch of an old banyan. There, he noticed nearby on another branch streaks of light that looked like fireflies or the scales of a python flashing in the night. Le Loi moved to this branch to get a closer look. At first sight, he mistook the strange light for a piece of rotten wood on which lived a phosphorescent centipede. But when he picked up the object it turned out to be a sword hilt made of horn. The gems inlaid in the hilt were shining brightly.&nbsp;Remembering the sword blade he saw in Le Than&rsquo;s camp, Le Loi decided to unite the pair and tucked it in his waistband. On that day the army reunited, Le Loi told everyone about the hilt he has found in the forest. He Took out the hilt to be matched with Le Than&rsquo;s sword blade. The two matched perfectly. Le Than and everyone else knelt down, shouting, &ldquo;God has bestowed on you this magic sword.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">After this event, Le Loi&rsquo;s army regained its strength. By contrast, the Ming troops became weaker from hardships and the pressure from Le Loi&rsquo;s army and had to retreat. Using his magic sword, Le Loi began to win a battles against the invaders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Finally, the Ming troops officially declared their surrender. After ten years of fighting, Le Loi&rsquo;s army gained a glorious victory in 1427. The whole nation was unified and Le Loi was enthroned as king. The people live in peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>&raquo;&nbsp;Return the sword </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">One beautiful day, Le Loi took a boat trip around Luc Thuy lake (Green water) in the centre of the capital city. It was early autumn, and lotus leaves were as green as the water surface. Suddenly, from under the lotus leaves emerged a huge tortoise. It had a raised back and looked as black as a bamboo boat. Then it raised it body. It clasped its two front legs and bowed to the king. &ldquo;Now that peace has restored to the nation, please return the sword to our God of waters.&rdquo; Le Loi immediately took out the sword that had remained tucked in his waistband since his victory. He respectfully raised the weapon above his sword remained and spread over the surface of the water. Since that time, the lakes has been named Ho Guom (Sword lake) or Ho Hoan Kiem (Restored Sword Lake).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>&raquo; The Turtle Tower </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"the-legend-of-sword-lake-turtle-tower\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/the-legend-of-sword-lake-turtle-tower.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">At the northern end of Hoan Kiem Lake is an islet on which stands a small tower called Thap Rua (Turtle Tower) with the structure honors the magic turtle that still guards the sword of Le Loi. The story goes that around 1886, a Vietnamese mandarin in the service of the French, persuaded the government to allow him to build a tower on the islet. What he kept secret was his intention to bury his father&rsquo;s remains on the Turtle Islet, a place considered favorable according to traditional feng shui belief. However, the people of the city discovered his plot and they removed his father&rsquo;s body. On the top of Turtle Tower there used to stand a version of the Statue of Liberty, placed there by the French. The statue was destroyed when the Tran Trong Kim government took over the city from the French administration in 1945.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Although only a shell of a building, with pointed Gothic arches not at all in the style of Vietnamese architecture, and built by one remembered as a traitor, Thap Rua has become an important symbol of both peace and patriotism to the people of Hanoi.

Our plan was to catch a bus to Ho Chi Minh City as soon as we arrived. However, 2 minutes after being on a cyclo and asking the rider to bring us to the bus station, the rider said: &ldquo;The bus station is closed your bus has gone.&rdquo; We know that this was not true and we even checked with the tour guide on the cruise. I told the cyclo rider firmly : &ldquo;Please take us to the bus station&rdquo; but he refused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite of our insistence, the cyclo rider stopped at the house of his relatives on an outlying countryside and transfer us to an old car of his relatives. We kept asking the cyclo rider to bring us back so we can catch another cyclo or taxi but in vain. Finally, we gave up and went with his friend to Ho Chi Minh city after 6 hours. It was late in comparison with our initial plan but at least we were safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>How to avoid this trape: </strong>From now on, we will try book the car via hotels or well-known travel agencies and ask for advices from other visitors.

When taking a tuktuk and give the driver the address of our hotel, we were asked : &ldquo;Have you paid for this place ?&rdquo;. Though his question was strange, I honestly reply : &ldquo;No, why did you ask so ?&rdquo;. He replied : &ldquo;This hotel is not good, we will take you to a better place.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Then, he took us to a hotel where he received a commission and not the recommended hotel by travel guide book that we booked. The &ldquo;Lake View&rdquo; hotel that this driver introduced to us seem to be nice but actually, our room did not have a window to view the lake as how it is named.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>How to avoid this trap:</strong> Follow your initial plan and tell the driver that you paid for the hotel. If you have not paid yet, don&rsquo;t forget to have a quick check of the hotel room before giving them the money. This will help you to eliminate the problem of getting a &ldquo;non-window&rdquo; room like us.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>3. Unstable fare for cyclo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">I always had troubles each time trying to catch a taxi in Vietnam. A cyclo rider pushed the fare 10 times higher than normal and after taking us to the destination, he insisted that we heard wrongly the initial price but we know that we did not because I always use finger to check the price the riders. Another trick that related to drivers is they often accept to take you and your friends with a fixed price then another drivers suddenly appeared and replacing the original one with the fare doubled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>How to avoid this trap: </strong>If you have found a taxi with measured fare by kilometres then you may have higher chance to be cheated. You may have more funs with the short trips and I often tips for honest drivers.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. &ldquo;This tour does not exist&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Our &ldquo;tricky&rdquo; trips in Vietnam ended the way it started.

This difference illustrates something very weird about last names: they&rsquo;re a surprisingly recent creation in most of the world, and there remain many places where they just aren&rsquo;t very important.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>The existence of family name in Vietnam&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nThe existence of last names in Vietnam dates to 111 BC, the beginning of a lengthy thousand-year occupation of the country by the Han Dynasty in China. (There were a few short-lived attempts at independence before the Vietnamese kicked the Chinese out in 939 AD.) Before this time, nobody really knows how the Vietnamese handled names, due to lack of written records. In fact even the name &ldquo;Vietnam&rdquo; originated from the Chinese; &ldquo;Viet&rdquo; is the Vietnamese version of the word the Chinese used to describe the people southeast of Yunnan Province.<br />\r\nIt is likely that the Vietnamese, prior to Chinese domination, did not use last names, (or family names, which we should call them, given that in Vietnam and many other places, this name does not come last). This does not make them unusual at all. Prior to the 18th century, much of the world did not use family names. More common would be what&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;patronymic&rdquo; name, meaning your full name would literally translate as something like &ldquo;Steve son of Bob.&rdquo; Patronymic names refer only to the generation immediately before and remain common in much of the world, especially in Scandinavia and the Middle East. (Keep an eye out for &ldquo;surnames&rdquo; ending in &ldquo;-sson&rdquo; or including &ldquo;Ben&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ibn.&rdquo; Those are patronymic names.)<br />\r\nThe entire idea of a family name was unknown to most of the world unless you were conquered by a place that used them. Those conquerors included the Romans, the Normans, the Chinese, and later the Spanish, the Portuguese, the Germans, and the Americans. It was the Chinese who gave Vietnam family names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>How popular &ldquo;Nguyen&rdquo; is in Vietnam?</strong><br />\r\nIndeed, Nguyen is the most common surname in Vietnam -an estimated 40 percent of people in the country (and the Vietnamese diaspora) carry the name, according to Vietnam&#39;s Tuoi Tre News.

Periodically, during both periods of Chinese rule as well as Vietnamese dynastic power in Vietnam, the name Nguyen was either forced upon the public (sometimes by threat of violence and even pain of death) by new regimes or adopted by the subjects voluntarily for various reasons.<br />\r\nBy the early 19th century, the Nguyen Dynasty seized power in Vietnam (which unified the country), prompting yet another wave of surname changes and adoptions. That dynasty, which &quot;awarded&quot; their surname to many people, ruled the country until the end of World War II. Esther Tran Le, a Vietnamese-American journalist based in New York, said that the name &lsquo;Nguyen&rsquo; was the last name of the last dynasty of Vietnamese emperors. &ldquo;Apparently the last King&#39;s name was Bao-Dai, but his real name was &lsquo;Nguyen-Vinh-Thu,&rsquo; she said. &ldquo;Many of the Vietnamese [peoples&rsquo;] last names derive from the former Emperors&#39; last names.&rdquo;<br />\r\nAs such, the surname Nguyen does not necessarily denote one&#39;s regional origins, class or even lineage. &ldquo;The surname itself has nothing to do with social class, unless it&#39;s combined with, say, Ph&uacute;c which is a combination of [the names of] the last royal family,&rdquo; said Dr. Nguyen-vo Thu-huong, associate professor in the departments of Asian Languages and Cultures and Asian American Studies at University of California, Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Presumably, as Vietnamese communities in Australia, France, Canada and the United States increase in number and political influence, we may see a new wave of lawmakers and other prominent public figures with the &lsquo;Nguyen&rsquo; surname.</p>\r\n', 'The most popular last name in Vietnam.jpg', '1', null, 'vietnamese last name ', 'Indeed, Nguyen is the most common surname in Vietnam -an estimated 40 percent of people in the country (and the Vietnamese diaspora) carry the name.

Outside the city of Hue&nbsp;and some parts of Central Vietnam, it is called Bun bo&nbsp;Hue to denote its origin. Within Hue&nbsp;and surrounding cities, it is known simply as bun bo. Since it&rsquo;s reputation has been spread out widely, tourist can taste Bun bo&nbsp;Hue in every big city, especially Hanoi and Saigon. However, the origin and quintessence of this beef soup can only be found in Hue&nbsp;city. &nbsp;<br />\r\nRobert Newton - A New York chef, who traveled extensively in Vietnam while gearing up to open his Brooklyn restaurant, Nightingale 9, found himself captivated by the soup. &ldquo;One of the best bowls of soup I had in all of Vietnam was from the Bun Bo Hue lady at Dong Ba,&rdquo; says Newton, referring to the bustling central market, crammed with stalls where one can buy jewelry, dried fish, cookware, hot soup, umbrellas, shrimp paste and much more. Said Robert &ldquo;Bun Bo Hue is soulful and rich and delicious and complex. It&rsquo;s spicier than most Vietnamese soups. It&rsquo;s just incredibly dynamic. I think it&rsquo;s one of Vietnam&rsquo;s greatest dishes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>&diams; What make the special flavour?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If Italian offers the world many type of fresh pasta and Japanese has it Ramen, Bun bo&nbsp;Hue is the pride of Vietnamese people, especially, people from the center region as <strong>Hue&nbsp;</strong>city. So, the question is what makes the distinct flavor of Bun bo&nbsp;Hue.&nbsp;<br />\r\nBun bo&nbsp;Hue is a popular soup in Huế containing rice vermicelli and beef cooked with the former royal court style. This dish is admired for its perfect combination of spicy, sour, salty, sweet and the predominant flavor of lemon grass. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>The special soup</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Vietnamese beef noodle the delicate beef soup. pg\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/Vietnamese beef noodle the delicate beef soup. pg.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nThe broth is prepared by simmering beef bones and beef shank with lemongrass and then seasoned with fermented shrimp sauce and sugar for taste. Spicy chili oil is added later during the cooking process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>The noodle or rice vermicelli</em><br />\r\nUnlike Italian pasta, most of the Vietnamese noodles are made from rice. However, in comparaison with&nbsp; &quot;Phở&quot; or &quot;B&uacute;n&quot;, the noodles of Bun bo&nbsp;Hue are thicker and more cylindrical.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In general, Bun bo&nbsp;Hue usually includes thin slices of marinated and boiled beef shank, chunks of oxtail, and pig&#39;s knuckles. It can also include cubes of congealed pig blood, which has a color between dark brown and maroon, and a texture resembling firm tofu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Vietnamese beef noodle how it is served jpg\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/Vietnamese beef noodle how it is served jpg.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Bun bo&nbsp;Hue</strong>&nbsp;is commonly served with lime wedges, cilantro sprigs, diced green onions, raw sliced onions, chili sauce, thinly sliced banana blossom, red cabbage, mint, basil, perilla, persicaria odorata or Vietnamese coriander, saw tooth herb and sometimes mung bean sprouts.

Once upon a time, the legend says, when a deluge of rain was pouring there descended from the sky a giant woman wearing on her head four huge round leaves as large as the sky itself and stitched together by bamboo sticks. The leaves protected humankind, then still naked, from the rain. The giant messenger from the sky twirled around the leaves on her head to dispel clouds and rains. Those who followed her were taught by her how to grow crops. Oneday mankind dozed off as they listened to stories narrated by her. When they woke up the goddess was gone. The Vietnamese built a temple in her memory and honored her as the Rain-shielding Goddess. Following her example, people went into the forests to fetch broad and round leaves (palm) which they stitched together on a bamboo frame. This was to become an indispensable headwear for the farmers on the fields, boat-women carrying passengers across rivers, travelers under the blazing sun&hellip;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"The beauty of Vietnamese conical hat \" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/The beauty of Vietnamese conical hat .jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Non L&aacute; </strong>was born since Vietnamese people stitch palm leaves together to make a hat modelling after the Goddess.

This <strong>conical hat</strong>&nbsp;is made out of such simple and available materials as palm leaves, bark of Moc tree and bamboo. <strong>N&oacute;n l&aacute;</strong> is abundantly sold and there are many traditional villages where tourists can get high quality conical hats. For example, the Chuong village &ndash; 30km South West of Hanoi, is best-known for its handmade palm-leaf <strong>conical hats</strong> for centuries. Especially, &lsquo;Non bai tho&rsquo; (poem hat) &ndash; a famous Non of Hue, has a picture of bamboo or even lyric lines of verse under the leaf-layer sunk designs, which is only seen under the sunlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"The beauty of Vietnamese conical hat Non bai tho jpg\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/The beauty of Vietnamese conical hat Non bai tho jpg.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>&lsquo;Non bai tho&rsquo; (poem hat) &ndash; a famous Non of Hue</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>N&oacute;n l&aacute;</strong> has many variations sinc its original version thousands of years ago after making first appearance over 3000 years ago. According to the old, in the past, people divided Non la into three main types: Non muoi (or &lsquo;Non ba tam&rsquo;, &lsquo;Non quai thao&rsquo;), medium-sized hat and head-hat. Non la used to be flat and round, about 1 metre in diameter, with a chin-strap in rattan (Non quai thao). Non quai thao is a crucial accessory of countryside women when they go to festivities or pagodas and as well as female singers in Lim festival. Head-hat is the smallest one with lowest selvage. At that time, people also classified the hats according to the owners&rsquo; levels. Some kinds were for the old; some were for the rich and mandarins; Non for kids, troops and monks. Each kind has its own shape and special manner; sometimes it differs regionally from each other.<br />\r\n<strong>N&oacute;n l&aacute;</strong> can serve numerous uses such as a personal sun proof, a basket for women going to market, a fan of a ploughman in hot summer days, or even a keepsake to memorize.

To make a liter of the alcohol, all that is required is a lot of time and effort. The wine is strictly processed. Firstly, more than 30 types of leaves are picked for fermentation. After that, kernels will be cooked until they become as big as fingertips then pour them out to cool down. Yeast will be milled and mixed well with cooked kernels and the mixture will be kept in bags for one week for distillation afterwards. Being meticulously processed, not only does Thien Huong wine give drinkers sweetness and delicious taste but it is still warm on the way down and you can actually get the depth of the taste. Although hundreds of years has gone through, the traditional beauty of the village stays the same. However, many people have been living in poverty. And that the bumpy road to it becomes muddy everytime the rain falls probably makes tourists hesitate to travel to this place.</p>\r\n', 'thien-huong-a -forgotten- 100-year-old -village-in- dong-van.jpg', '1', null, 'thien huong, dong van, ha giang ', 'What’s more, that the mountain was so high as if they could meet the clouds made me think of \"a sky gate\" of Dong Van.', '4', '4', 'thien huong, dong van, ha giang ', '67', '0', '0', '0', '2018-04-24 10:02:17', '2018-04-24 10:02:17', '1,4');

Accept the challenge and risk, sometimes you will get addicted to solo travel.', '<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Travel alone to refresh and challenge yourself. That is not only an adventure but an opportunity to expand the horizons, discover interesting things about yourself and a world you&rsquo;ve never known as well. As the famous American traveler and writer, Paul Theroux has advised: &quot;There are three basic rules of travel. First, let&#39;s travel the road. Second, if possible, travel alone. Third, find out carefully and keep a record of where you are going. That&#39;s all.&quot;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Traveling alone doesn&rsquo;t mean you are lonely</strong><br />\r\nParadoxical as it may seem, solo travel will make it easier for you to add new friends. Local people and other travelers will be more open to talk to people traveling alone. You will be amazed when unexpectedly talking with a stranger in such an easy way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. The experience is much more valuable than artifacts</strong><br />\r\nStudies have shown that the secret of happiness is spending money on experience, not on materials. Recent research from San Francisco State University shows that the feeling of blissful happiness from a shopping spree will soon fade and disappear, but travel memories will follow the rest of your life. Investing in a solo trip is a way to save for everlasting experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3.&nbsp;You are not who you were yesterday</strong><br />\r\nTravel to discover new things of your own, and to open your heart to the colorful life. Traveling alone brings you an opportunity to embrace new cultures and immerse yourself in a completely different world. Just join a volunteer trip or choose to stay longer than intended to really understand the rhythm and daily pace of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4.&nbsp;Be self-prepared for your solo travel addiction</strong><br />\r\nScary as it may sound, once you get rid of your fears and take on the challenge yourself in order to make your first solo journey in life (the decision that more and more travelers are making now), you will not give up!<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5.

Take it slow and take the time to immerse yourself in the sunset reading a book, or conquer a mountain, drink coffee in the early sun at a sidewalk caf&eacute; - these are priceless rewards of traveling alone. It gives you time to rejuvenate your mind and have a free vacation from distractions and stressful work.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6.

You can completely take control of your financial status</strong><br />\r\nWhen traveling with friends and family, budgeting can be a real issue. Someone wants to eat a restaurant, sleep the hotel while others just want to eat noodles in the right style of road trip. If you travel solo, however, you do not have to worry about satisfying everyone or being &quot;overdrawn&quot; or &quot;bankrupt.&quot;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>9.

Bai Choi has played an important role in Hoi An residents&rsquo; spiritual life for centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Bai Choi originated among farmers in the Quang region, where watch-towers were set up to watch over the rice fields. While they were on duty, village boys posted in the towers communicated with each other by singing songs or chanties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A tradition developed of holding a week-long spring Bai Choi festival each year from the 30th day of the 12th lunar month. In the yard of the communal house or pagoda or some other wide space, ten bamboo platforms on stilts are built, each platform accommodating 4 or 5 players. These serve as watch-towers in the game of Bai Choi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Phung Tan Dong, a culture expert in Hoi An, explains the rules of the game: &ldquo;Bai Choi is a complex cultural activity which combines a game of chance with poetry, music, singing, and acting. There are 2 decks of 30 cards. One deck is placed in a bamboo tube on a stage. The other deck is distributed to the players in the watch-towers. Cards are drawn at random from the tube, and as each card is drawn, its name is announced. Whichever watch-tower has that card receives a flag. The first team to gain 3 flags wins the game.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In 1996, the Hoi An Traditional Art Performance Theater was founded, and Bai choi was staged for the entertainment of tourists for the very first time.<br />\r\nTwo years later, a Bai choi performance space was created to entertain tourists on full-moon nights in the ancient town of Hoi An. This performance space creates a more intimate connection between the performers and the audience. Today Bai Choi games take place every night along the bank of the Ho&agrave;i River and attract an incredible number of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tran Dinh Chau, Deputy Director of Hoi An&rsquo;s Culture and Sport Center, says: &ldquo;We have turned Bai choi, a folk game, into a folk art form which has a great importance in the community. The genre is loved by young and old.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A master of ceremonies dubbed &ldquo;Mr. Hieu&rdquo; plays the important role of controlling the game and engaging the audience. After drawing a card from the bamboo tube on the stage, Mr. Hieu immediately improvises a short lyric based on what the card says.<br />\r\nThe solo performance by Mr. Hieu reading out the cards, and call-and-response singing and joking by the players in the watch-towers, constitute the attraction of Bai choi.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'bai-choi-art-performance.jpg', '1', null, '', 'Previously on May, a ceremony was held in Binh Dinh province, to receive a certificate recognizing Bai Choi, a form of folk singing popular in central Vietnam, as a UNESCO intangible heritage of humanity.', '4', '4', '', '40', '0', '0', '0', '2018-05-11 01:35:29', '2018-05-11 01:35:29', '');

The island itself is rather small, and these days due to the increasing numbers of tourist boats that stop here it tends to be quite full. However, arriving in the morning will give you a head start against the crowds, and ample chance to hike up to 400 odd steps to reach the viewpoint where you can kick back in the gazebo for a little while and enjoy the awesome views of the surrounding bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Cruises: </strong>Aclass Legend Cruise, Aclass Stellar Cruise, Carina Cruise, Glory Legend Cruise, Gray Line Halong, Pelican Cruise</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><a name=\"6.

The inner caverns are wide, tall, and surprisingly spacious, which makes walking around inside comfortable and easy. Stalactites and stalagmites adorn the cave&rsquo;s interior, some of which meet to form full pillars and all sorts of interesting shapes; the locals will take any chance they can get to share the &lsquo;legend&rsquo; of each one of these formations (dragons, demons, and dwarves all play a part, so get ready to be imaginative!).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Cruises:</strong> Aclass Stellar Cruise, Carina Cruise, Glory Legend Cruise, Pelican Cruise, Rosa Cruise&nbsp;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><a name=\"7. Thien Cung Cave\"><strong>7.&nbsp;Thien Cung Cave</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"top-10-of-the-most-magnificent-halong-bay-attractions-cat-ba-Thien-cung-cave\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/top-10-of-the-most-magnificent-halong-bay-attractions-cat-ba-Thien-cung-cave.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Just a few short kilometers to the north of another <strong>Halong Bay</strong> attraction - Da Gau Island- is Thien Cung Cave, yet another of Halong&rsquo;s legend-laden grottoes.

Between the white sandy beaches, the turquoise water, the craggy cliff faces, the cheap and delicious seafood, Co To Island is so much more than just another <strong>Halong Bay </strong>attraction.

Mong ethnic group</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"ha-giang-ethnic-minority-group-hmong\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/ha-giang-ethnic-minority-group-hmong.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nThe group is also known as &quot;Mẹo&quot; (pronounced with the lowest pitch),&nbsp; &quot;M&egrave;o (pronounced with rather low pitch), Mieu Ha, and Man Trang. Mong ethnic minority consists of several local groups, namely, White Mong, Flowery Mong, Red Mong, Black Mong, Blue Mong, Na Mieo. The group&rsquo;s population is approximately 200,000 which makes up 31% of all population in Ha Giang province. The major Ha Giang ethnic groups, White Mong and Flowery Mong settle mainly in nothern districts such as Quan Ba, Yen Minh, Dong Van, Meo Vac, and the other two western districts Hoang Su Phi and Xin Man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>&diams; Special housing habbit&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"ha-giang-ethnic-minority-group-hmong-house\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/ha-giang-ethnic-minority-group-hmong-house.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The architecture of their houses is strongly influenced by their living conditions and the harsh terrain and weather. They build houses of earthen walls and tile or grass roofs to keep the house warm in winter and cool in summer and to protect them from evildoers and wild beasts. This is why culture of Mong people comes out as one of a kind, compared to other ethnic groups&rsquo; of Dong Van Plateau. Not only does it refer to their wealth but also their time living in the area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"ha-giang-ethnic-minority-group-hmong-rustic-house\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/ha-giang-ethnic-minority-group-hmong-rustic-house.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>&diams; Festival&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tet holiday is the most special time of the year as they don&rsquo;t hold many festivals all year round. That is an ideal break after a year of hard work and sipping some scented green tea is how they enjoy the holiday. Tet holiday here comes at 30rd of lunar November (1 month prior to traditional Tet of Kinh people) and lasts in 3 days. When spring arrives, they gather together to worship &nbsp;as a way to honor their ancestors and pray for good health and wealth. Tet preparation is well made before 30th of lunar November. They clean up their houses, decorate altars and make day cake (round sticky rice cake) instead of Chung cake like Kinh people. They decorate the altars with unique and distinctive features. They think that things need time to rest, just like human, so that they can build up their strength for a hard-working upcoming year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2. Pa Then ethnic group</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"ha-giang-ethnic-minority-group-pa-then\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/ha-giang-ethnic-minority-group-pa-then.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This is one of the ethnic minorities with nearly 5000 people living in several communes of Ha Giang. That number only contributes a small proportion to Vietnam&rsquo;s 80 million citizens in total. However, during their livelihood, they were able to cultivate their own unique culture, from costumes, musical instruments, customs, lifestyles, religious beliefs and cultural events, not to mention the unique Fire Dancing Festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"ha-giang-ethnic-minority-group-pa-then-fire-festival\" src=\"https://authentiktravel.com/media/ckeditor/ha-giang-ethnic-minority-group-pa-then-fire-festival.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In this festival, a huge flickering fire is burnt, and anyone about to jumping into the fire will sit near the it. The village&rsquo;s shaman is in charge of announcing the official reasons to host the festival and invites gods to attend the ritual with locals. According to Sister Van Phong, souls of those who can jump fire are conform to the spirits of gods. They will be given strength, courage and protected so that their feet and bodies are not damaged by fire. Young people, therefore, will not be burnt out, even their hair and clothes<br />\r\nSo far, the secret of the &quot;jump fire&quot; etiquette has been still in the veil of secrecy not an &nbsp;organization or individual is capable of discovering it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://authentiktravel.com/4-seasons-in-ha-giang\">4 seasons in Ha Giang </a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>3.

Lo Lo people&rsquo;s agricultural economy depends mainly on rice and maize. Domestic husbandry is relatively developed and is a significant source of income. The first feature to identify Lo Lo Hoa culture is partten costumes of women. They often wear often wear a low-neck vest and a pair of trousers underneath a short skirt. These costumes are carefully decorated with patterns such as geometric pattern (triangle, square), cardamom fruit, &ldquo;ngo ba&rdquo; bird which shows their a delicate aesthetic taste. The Lo Lo ethnic group usually holds many traditional festivals yearly such as Spring Festival from lunar December 25 to the full moon of the next lunar January, Corn Harvest Festival on traditional Lunar New Year.

Phu La people consist of two groups - Lao Va Xơ and Pu La and those now living in Ha Giang belong to Pu La group. They live on high mountains and gather in small, separated villages. Each village includes 10-15 families, living in earthen houses, with many other ethnic groups such as Mong, Dao, Tay, Nung nearby. Village elders, village chiefs, and clan chiefs play a very important role in village management. At present, Phu La people still preserve their folk culture as they have various forms of oral literature. Besides, themes of their traditional stories are mainly solidarity and the power of good over evil.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt; Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://authentiktravel.com/vietnamese-ethnic-people-through-the-eyes-of-a-french\">Vietnamese ethnic people through the eyes of a French&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'ha-giang-ethnic-minority-tribe.jpg', '1', null, 'ha giang ethnic group, ha giang ', 'HA GIANG: Most of people in Ha Giang, a province located in northwestern part of Vietnam, are from ethnic minority groups such as Mong, Pa Then, Lo Lo, Phu La and Tay.', '4', '3', 'ha giang ethnic group, ha giang ', '21', '0', '0', '0', '2018-07-11 06:45:12', '2018-06-28 03:25:11', '2');

The first, who accompanied us on the first day, was presented to us by the guide as a driver &quot;unprofessional&quot; but overall, it went well. A second driver came for our trip to Ben Tre and Can Tho. His work was generally correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) The guide: He was nice, but he was not up to the first 3 guides:&nbsp;<br />\r\n- His French was correct but he had a strong accent and made some clumsiness, which made understanding sometimes difficult.&nbsp;<br />\r\n- Lack of organization and / or anticipation<br />\r\n- Lack of flexibility<br />\r\nIn short, here is the record that we can make of the trip.

Just perfect!&nbsp;<br />\r\nIt corresponded perfectly to our expectations ... I found that my requests were heard and taken into account throughout the preparation phase of the trip ...<br />\r\nIndeed, We had booked the plane since November 2011 ... and started contacting agencies around December and then with the end of the year holidays here and Tet in Vietnam, we restarted our preparations in March 2012 and, the time of the exchanges, to know what one wanted ... etc, we would go towards a proposal when I found the address of Guide Francophone on the internet ...<br />\r\nAnd there, we immediately found that the exchanges were fast, clear, precise and that, especially, my request to have the possibility to carry out family research while visiting Vietnam (with times and free meals) was heard and taken into account ...<br />\r\nIn addition, you had interesting suggestions (like the North off Sapa) .. and always suggested without imposing anything ... It was important for us.<br />\r\nIt is these quick and personalized responses that have seduced us ... then having been able to easily get on the phone during my difficulties in making a transfer to your bank account, has totally reassured us.<br />\r\nThe support in its entirety:<br />\r\nWe feel totally accompanied and appreciated to be able to call for any question we may have and have a listening and an answer right away.<br />\r\nWe really enjoyed seeing you before we came back to France and you asked for our impressions of this trip ... This shows the interest you have in those who seek your services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The guides?<br />\r\nWhat can we say that we have not already said? ....<br />\r\nWe found each of them different but all nice overall ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For my part, I really appreciated Quang&#39;s investment in my family research in Hoang Hoa, your support in my with explanations during our tours of Hanoi&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe invite you to discover Vietnam and a base to understand its culture, its religions, the history and to better approach the rest of the trip. Perhaps we would have the poser more question? But the contact with him, although far from being unpleasant, did not seem to us enough personal or natural for questions to emerge ...<br />\r\nHanoi, Ninh Binh or Halong Bay and I think it&#39;s also a question of personality; a small group like our tendency to be more demanding in the human relationship than a group of 20 or 30 people, especially with a guide who accompanies several days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We greatly appreciated the skills in the knowledge that in the human relationship of Khai ... We propose to be warned and we knew it would seem &quot;out of the ordinary&quot; compared to others ....<br />\r\nThe fact of having made the part of Vietnam (the north with the minority ethnic groups ... the homestays ... the landscapes of dreams) which has a charm with him, a magic moment for all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Hue and Hoi An, we tried not to make any comparison with Khai of course and we appreciated Anh Tuan, nice guy who made us discover these sites in a very interesting way. He proposed us activities for the two free days we had in Hoi An but we preferred to lead them as we please between strolls in the old town, making clothes and shoes and beach ... He found us to accompany us to Danang airport for us fly to the central highlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Buon Ma Thuot, we were welcomed and supported by Quoc, a young guide passionate about his region and the vegetation with a very good knowledge of the ethnic groups both from the center and the North. He is very pleasant and full of humor with the dynamism of his age.<br />\r\nAs Jo&euml;lle pointed out, it would have been interesting to schedule another visit or activity to fill the afternoon after the elephant ride and before our plane at 18h. We had suggested in Quoc the village of Tur which Khai had spoken to us, but it would have been necessary to anticipate with the appropriate authorizations. It is the only small flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then went to Saigon where Truong welcomed us and took charge. After the enchantment of the North, the South (and even the Mekong Delta) seemed very bland.<br />\r\nFor my part, I found that there was a real disappointment to make this city without history and so Western after living three weeks actually cut off from the West in authentic places but it was our choice to start from the North. You are not for nothing, of course!<br />\r\nI found Truong very interesting in these explanations and appreciated his availability to help me communicate with my family from Saigon.<br />\r\nHowever, I have struggled with his direction and omni-present both physically and orally but this opinion is binding only me, of course, and my friends Joelle and Daniel may have another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drivers? all very nice and reassuring. We really appreciated the contact with Manh, the driver from the North.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accommodations? Largely in agreement and even beyond our expectations both hotel and homestay. I admit that the homestay I missed in the second part of the stay. The contact is so warm and authentic!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here is a recap as sincere as possible on the whole trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion<br />\r\nThis trip had for me 2 objectives: to try to find traces of the families of my parents and to know sufficiently Vietnam in its authenticity to want to return there ...<br />\r\nThe objectives have been achieved beyond our expectations since I found more than traces of my family: I found a family and I already know that I will come back soon!<br />\r\nWe had, moreover, had some &quot;bonuses&quot; with a favorable weather, the possibility to see the hype of the rice, a karaoke party, multiple opportunities to make &quot; sức khỏe&quot;, and (should we remember it?) Some defeat card games with Khai! ... you&#39;d have to be very demanding to complain !!!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had the best guide in Vietnam ... .but maybe we would have the pleasure of having his student next time?<br />\r\nIn the meantime, I wish you to stay as close to your customers, as much to their listening and especially as listening to their heart ... this is what makes you unique in your genre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Cam on&quot; for everything and even short news will please us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking forward to seeing&nbsp;you again,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maimouna</p>\r\n', null, '1', null, '0', '0', '5.0', '0', null, '', '', '2012-12-11 00:00:00', '2017-11-28 01:02:59', '6', '6');
